# vue-project-test
 Objective:

Create a web application that allows JavaScript developers to scan their package.json file for vulnerabilities.

This exercise is designed to evaluate your coding and design skills, and ability to present your solution effectively.

 

User Story:

As a JavaScript developer, I want to scan my package.json file for vulnerabilities so that I can identify and address any vulnerable dependencies.

 

Functional Requirements:

    The user can select a package.json file from their local filesystem.
    The application analyzes the selected package.json file and displays a list of any vulnerable dependencies.
    The interface should be intuitive, with vulnerabilities clearly highlighted.

 

Technical Requirements:

    Implement the web app using Vue 3 and TypeScript.
    You may use components libraries, CSS modules or a library like Tailwind CSS for styling.
    Use the Open Source Vulnerabilities API (https://osv.dev/) to fetch vulnerability data for dependencies.
    Follow best practices for version control, including meaningful commit messages and a clear commit history.

 

Evaluation Criteria:

    Design and User Experience: Review the overall design of the interface and user experience.
    Code Quality: Assess the quality of your code, including readability, structure, and adherence to best practices.
    Commit History: Evaluate the clarity and documentation of your commit history, reflecting your development process.
    Problem-Solving Skills: Demonstrate your ability to produce a working solution from requirements.
    Communication Skills: Evaluate how well you communicate your ideas and explain your code during the interview.

 

Submission Guidelines:

Host your code on a public git repository. Respond to this email with a link to your repository. After submission, we will review your code and schedule a code review interview. During this interview, you will demonstrate your solution and walk us through your code. We look forward to discussing your approach and any design decisions you made. Please submit your work by end of day Feb. 13th.

 

Important Notes:

    You may use any tools or libraries you see fit, but be prepared to justify your choices and discuss the code in details.
    This exercise is an opportunity to showcase your UI design skills and front-end development experience in a context similar to our team's work. Feel free to add any additional features or enhancements that you believe would improve the application. This is an opportunity to showcase your creativity and initiative, and how you can add value beyond the basic requirements.
    While you can spend as much time as you like on this exercise, we recommend dedicating between 1 to 4 hours to it.
